# (Not Related) O'Reilly Learning OpenSearch Book Dump

## Introduction
One can download the contents of O'Reilly Learning's library using the [O'Reilly Learning API Scraper](https://github.com/davidshq/oreillyas). Once this is done one can load the data into OpenSearch and query against it using this repository.

## Usage
- You need to setup valid values in your `.env` file, see the `.env.example` file for more information.
- At the end of the code type the name of the function you want to execute, e.g. `delete_document_by_query()` to execute that query.
