# (Not Related) O'Reilly Learning OpenSearch Book Dump

## Introduction
One can download the contents of O'Reilly Learning's library using the [O'Reilly Learning API Scraper](https://github.com/davidshq/oreillyas). Once this is done one can load the data into OpenSearch and query against it using this repository.

## Usage
- You need to setup valid values in your `.env` file, see the `.env.example` file for more information.
- Uncomment the code you want to run in `main.py` and run it. Pretty complicated stuff.
